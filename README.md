# Suspension Travel CAN device for RaceChrono
Using an Adafruit Feather nRF52832 in order to send suspension travel data via
bluetooth in the RaceChrono app.

Coded based on info found under this repo https://github.com/aollin/racechrono-ble-diy-device

As of today (07/2023) RaceChono does not support adding more than one DIY BLE Device.

If you need to measure in more than one corners / axles with the potentiometer method consider
using this version: https://github.com/sikrip/suspension-travel-RejsaRubberTrac
that is built on top of https://github.com/MagnusThome/RejsaRubberTrac and also uses the later MLX90640 sensor.
